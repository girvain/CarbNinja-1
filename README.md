Brief:

After winning the account, you have now been awarded the project of producing design documentation and digitally designed 
elements for use within a web based mobile application suitable for the proposed device for the local medical establishment. 
You will agree a scope (choice of device, platform, what the app will do, how it will do it and what the app will not do or 
allow regarding push notifications, etc, user expectations and a workable schedule) with your client (your lecturer). You
